Welcome to the Flutter Workshop on GitHub! We are excited to have you join us for this opportunity to learn and grow your skills in Flutter development.

In this workshop, you will be learning the basics of Flutter, as well as more advanced concepts, such as local databases, online databases, authentication, API handling, mastering Flutter UI kit, and more. You will also receive advice on your career as a software developer and learn the principles of software engineering, including best practices on clean code and architecture.

To get the most out of this workshop, it is important to attend each session at its specified time, finish the tasks and push them on GitHub, provide feedback about the mentors or instructors, collaborate with other participants, ask questions on Classroom, and take advantage of the mentor's availability.
